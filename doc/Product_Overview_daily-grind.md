# Product Overview Document: daily-grind

## 1. Product Name

daily-grind

## 2. Vision & Tagline

**Vision:** Your daily briefing of tech news, brewed just for you, right in your terminal.

## 3. Problem Statement

Developers, Tech Leads, and SREs are inundated with a constant stream of updates, release notes, and security bulletins across their entire toolchain (cloud providers, open-source projects, SaaS tools, etc.). Keeping up is a time-consuming, manual process of visiting multiple websites, subscribing to newsletters, and scanning RSS feeds. This information fragmentation leads to context switching, knowledge gaps, and the risk of missing critical updates.

## 4. Solution

daily-grind is a fun, coffee-themed Gemini CLI extension that acts as a personal "news barista." It provides a single, simple command (`g! brew_me_a_summary`) to fetch, consolidate, and intelligently summarize the latest updates from a user-defined list of sources.

It starts as a simple local tool and evolves into a powerful, shareable service that can query central data sources (like BigQuery) for release notes, turning your CLI into a smart, conversational research assistant.

## 5. Target Personas

### P1: The Polyglot Developer ("Sam")

Works on 3-4 projects using different stacks (e.g., Go, Python, GCP, Kubernetes). Needs to track updates for all of them without spending an hour every morning.

### P2: The Tech Lead ("Alex")

Responsible for platform direction. Needs to stay ahead of major changes from key vendors (e.g., "What's the latest on Google Cloud's GKE?" or "What's new in the latest GitLab release?") to make informed architectural decisions.

### P3: The DevOps/SRE Engineer ("Dana")

Manages infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines. Must be immediately aware of updates to tools like Terraform, Prometheus, and their cloud provider's APIs.

## 6. High-Level Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: The "Local Cafe" (v0.1)

**Goal:** Establish local functionality and a delightful user experience.
**Features:**

- Fun, non-functional "coffee suggestion" tool to confirm installation.
- Basic MCP tool to read and summarize local text files.

### Phase 2: The "Coffee Chain" (v1.0 - Core MVP)

**Goal:** Deliver the core "coffee reading" value proposition.
**Features:**

- New MCP tool to fetch and parse remote RSS/Atom feeds.
- A simple, user-editable `my_grind_list.json` file to manage feed URLs.
- A primary custom command (`brew_me_a_summary`) that uses the feed list and MCP tool to provide a consolidated summary.

### Phase 3: The "Specialty Roaster" (v2.0 - Team & Power-User)

**Goal:** Scale the solution for teams and advanced queries.
**Features:**

- Introduce advanced data-backed tools (e.g., "MCP Toolbox" for BigQuery) to query release notes by product name instead of URL.
- Deploy the MCP server remotely (e.g., on Cloud Run) so it's always available, secure, and shareable for an entire team.
- The extension configuration in `gemini-extension.json` is updated to point to the remote server.

## 7. Why Gemini CLI?

The Gemini CLI is the perfect platform. Its extension framework, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and summarization capabilities allow us to seamlessly blend custom tools (fetching data) with powerful AI (summarizing data) directly in the developer's native environment: the terminal.
